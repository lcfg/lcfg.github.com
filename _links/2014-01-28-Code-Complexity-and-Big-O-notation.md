A brief field guide to code complexity. Hosted by computer science professor[Mary K. Vernon](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~vernon/), this article illustrates such concepts as code performance and complexity, demonstrates problem sizes and helps us make some rudimentary calculations. A great introduction to complexities and Big-O notation. The [entirety of the course](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~vernon/cs367/notes/) seems to be available.
