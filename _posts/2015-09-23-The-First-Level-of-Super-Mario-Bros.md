The title of this post is actually the title of [a research paper (pdf)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom7/mario/mario.pdf) written by <b>Tom Murphy</b> ([@tom7](https://twitter.com/tom7)). The paper, which describes how computers might <b>learn to play Super Mario Bros.</b>, was submitted to SIGBOVIK '13 ("[..] a yearly conference celebrating the inestimable research work of Harry Quasi-bovik Bovik"). A conference described by Tom as "an April 1 conference that usually publishes fake research".

&nbsp;

On the conference's website we can read that SIGBOVIK is "<i>traditionally a forum for discussion on many subjects</i>". What follows is a list of inexplicable subjects including "Rasterized Love Triangles", "Regret-Minimizing Algorithms" and "Science". Tom's research led him to develop two programs (<b>playfun</b> & <b>learnfun</b>) that allow Tom to sit back and watch his computer mostly fail, but also succeed (sometimes in spectacularly <b>glitching</b> fashion) at NES games.

&nbsp;

Unlike most papers (I've read), Tom's is thorougly lucid, irreversibly deepened my understanding of programming and machine learning, contained colourful screenshots of NES games and was a blast to read ("Caching of emulation" is one subchapter, "Color a dinosaur" another).

Alongside the paper Tom took the time to record [three videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ-I7v-e2txK_Y_zU6q6TUr6-P5eWzXUd) that serve as a showcase of his work. If you have an hour to spare and are interested in watching a computer program play Bubble Bobble, Tetris and figure out glitches in Super Mario Bros., be sure to [check out these videos](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom7/mario/).
